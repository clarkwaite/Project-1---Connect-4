# First WDI 10 Project - Unit-01
WDI 10 First Project - Connect 4 Game


Connect 4

Write a Connect 4 game that allows two players to compete. The players are sharing the same computer but the game detects when a player has won the game. A scoreboard keeps track of how many times Player 1 has won and how many times Player 2 has won.

Bonuses:

Alternate the first player to move: Player 1 moves first in game 1, Player 2 moves first in game 2, etc.
Allow players to enter their name and display their name instead of "Player 1" and "Player 2".
Provide a way to play against the computer (using a simple A.I. algorithm)

Bonuses for Any Game

Keep score
Make it responsive
Add A.I. (player vs. computer)
Add a timer
Add music while a player makes a choice
Create a theme via background images, sounds, music, avatars, etc.
Star Wars
Favorite Sports Team or Rivalry
Comic Book Characters
Add avatar choices for the player
Implement multiple games on your site

Planning and Deliverables

Project Plan Deliverables (Due at time of Presentation):

All source code is checked into GitHub
create a repo for your app and show that you've been commiting early and often while utilizing clear commit messages.
30+ commits
A README.md file containing:
A Project description
A Link to the Deployed App
A Link to the Trello Board
A Link to any Wirefames or Mockups (or inline photos / screenshots will work too!)
A list of technologies, libraries, and/or frameworks used in the project, such as Twitter Bootstrap, jQuery, or Animate.css
What you would like to add in version 2
Wireframes or Mockups -- what does the app look like?
Simple: take a picture of a whiteboard drawing
Advanced: use a tool such as Balsamiq or Mockingbird
User Stories in Trello
You should have a Trello board tracking your User Stories
Board lists should include:
Backlog
Todo
In Progress
Under Review
Done
Icebox
Sample Project README.md files:

Tic-Tac-Toe
FootUp
Technical Requirements

Your app must:

Render a game in the browser
Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
Switch turns between two players and/or use some A.I. to control the game.
Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Write high quality code:
Follow accepted naming conventions
Consistent indentation
Well-structured and readable code
Semantic naming of variables, functions, CSS classes, etc.
Short and clear functions that do one thing
Efficient code- if you have your MVP, refactor
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code
Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it.
Suggested default options for deployment include Github Pages or BitBalloon
Suggested Ways to Get Started

First design your MVP (Minimum Viable Product). Have a plan for completing an MVP before getting too involved with advanced features.
Use Trello to prioritize your User Stories / features. Focus on what is most important / critical to success.
Timebox any experimental or optional ideas, features, or technologies. Remember that good time management is key!
Commit your code early and often with good commit messages.
Use Git Branching for experimenting with different ideas and technologies.
Attendance, expectations of time commitment

Typically students are required to be in class working on their project during regular class hours. And students continue to work on their project in the evening, dedicating the same amount of time if not more as they do on their homework.

Standups

We encourage you to hold your stand-ups in the mornings when you start working to help you all keep each other accountable and help each other out. When you start working each day, reach out on Slack and see if anyone is around to hold a standup!

If you have ideas on how you can help a fellow-student with work that they are stuck on, please follow-up with information AFTER the stand up.

Tuesday, May 9th
You will come with your choice of project, pseudo-code, wireframes and user stories

Where to go for help during project week

Seek out help online
Seek out help with your buddy
Seek out help with your classmates
Submit GitHub issues to the repo and paste links in the debugging channel to ask for advice
Ask questions and communicate with your classmates over the Debugging Channel
Post to Stack Overflow, be sure to follow the format for submitting bug reports, provide lots of context!
Javascript and Jquery videos produced by GA!
Formatting your GitHub Issue for atl-wdi-10 to ask for help

COMMIT/PUSH OFTEN! Your code on GitHub should be up to date. Submitting an issue and linking your classmates to old, out-of-date code will hinder the process.

WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SOLVE:
Write a detailed explanation of the feature or user story you're working on.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE BUG/ERROR:
A detailed description of the problem, the bug, and/or the error. This means: the full steps to reproduce, a link to the file on github, and the line number of where the relevant code is. The error(s) returned, copy and pasted/typed out/screenshot, not paraphrased.
If there is other code in a different file that is also essential to the functioning of the code that currently works point us to that and explain the relationship.
WHAT I'VE TRIED
List everything you've done to solve the bug on your own in detail. list all resources you've looked up and tried to implement and provide links. Providing code if you have it surrounded by the md syntax to display nicely is very helpful.
QUESTION
After going through all this what is your questions specifically, more specifically than how can I make this work?
Project Feedback + Evaluation

Your project will be evaluated by your instructional team in order to provide you with useful feedback. The following criteria will be used for the evaluation:

Project Workflow: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, README, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected (30+ commits) for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

Technical Requirements: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

Creativity: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user?

Code Quality: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

Deployment: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages or something equivalent?

Total: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

Score Expectations
0 Incomplete.
1 Does not meet expectations.
2 Meets expectations, good job!
3 Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!
This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but the more important scores are the individual ones above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
